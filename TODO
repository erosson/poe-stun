goal: integrate pob with monster data and stuns.

* how much damage + stunthreshold do I need to stun monsters, champs, rares, map bosses, pinnacle bosses?
* How many am I already stunning? How often?
* how often do I stun with spiky damage, not just average damage - ruthless, double%, triple%, multistrike, natural damage range...
* something similar for defenses. pob calculates elemental max hits now, but that data has no context - monsters have damage data - which monsters can one-shot me, and which just barely can't?

todo:

* [x] decode pob data
      average damage + attack speed are there, but not stun threshold/duration or spike damage
* [ ] embed headless pob, calculate the stats we need
      this is pretty complicated, let's manually input the relevant data for now...
      maybe we could start as a "time until monster dies, based on dps" calculator
      or a "which slams can you (not) tank" calculator
* [ ] extract monster data with poe-dat-viewer. DefaultMonsterStats.dat?
      or, scrape poedb?
* [ ] monster stat calculations. start with stun-ehp: hp, damage reduction, armor, stun threshold, level scaling...
      this looks to be nontrivial. https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/8fqsx1/monster_health_and_other_monster_stats_spreadsheet/
